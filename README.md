## Ben Linn Project 15

## [ Frontend ] (https://wtwr.crabdance.com)

## [ Backend ] (https://api.wtwr.crabdance.com)

## Running the Project

## Git Repository se_project_react https://github.com/blinn26/se_project_react.git

## Git Repository se_project_express https://github.com/blinn26/se_project_express.git

`npm run start` — to launch the server on http://localhost:3000/

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature for development backend on local machine

## Postman Testing

Error Handling Process with API
Error Codes 200,400,401,403,404,409,500,11000

## Middleware

Authentication , Error Handling, Logging and Validations. Middlewares is the area where this is done.

## EsLint

Eslint is an area I personally like to use, its a area of disabling and creating to me. Its a rules section set by the developer.

## BACK END Configuration

This Project taught me the most out of any project thus far. Being inside multiple terminals, such as VM for Google Cloud Services, the terminal for my main machine and last but not least the terminal for VS code. Having to run Node.js, MongoDB, Celebrate , Nginx, PM2, Winston and Cors in these and make sure they are all on same versions then up to date with each other and no errors or warnings.

Going through the process of VM was a process to and I also know that there is still much to learn looking how much Google Cloud Services has inside of it. Seems we are just using 1/40th of the actual potential of it and that was a process in and of itself. It makes me respect the how much there still is to learn and what I still can learn in the future.

Backend seems more sensitive then frontend on settings and harder to find or navigate to, I think that is why it takes longer to understand and I repsect back end configuration and still have lots to learn in the future and can see why it takes years to learn the backend.

## TESTING

This whole project to me was a test, a test of the backend, the test of tying front to the back, the test if I can follow instructions. A test if I could make the journey, a test of will, a test of will I not give up if things crash or break! They did crash and break, but I kept trudging and pursued!
