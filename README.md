# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

## Postman Testing

Error Handling Process with API
Error Codes 200,400,401,403,404,409,500,11000

## BACK END Configuration

This Project taught me the most out of any project thus far. Being inside multiple terminals, such as VM for Google Cloud Services, the terminal for my main machine and last but not least the terminal for VS code. Having to run Node.js, MongoDB, Celebrate , Nginx, PM2, Winston and Cors in these and make sure they are all on same versions then up to date with each other and no errors or warnings.

Going through the process of VM was a process to and I also know that there is still much to learn looking how much Google Cloud Services has inside of it. Seems we are just using 1/40th of the actual potential of it and that was a process in and of itself. It makes me respect the how much there still is to learn and what I still can learn in the future.

Backend seems more sensitive then frontend on settings and harder to find or navigate to, I think that is why it takes longer to understand and I repsect back end configuration and still have lots to learn in the future and can see why it takes years to learn the backend.

## TESTING

This whole project to me was a test, a test of the backend, the test of tying front to the back, the test if I can follow instructions. A test if I could make the journey, a test of will, a test of will I not give up if things crash or break! They did crash and break, but I kept trudging and pursued!
